Description: Solution for CERTs to process data feeds, paste
 IntelMQ is a solution for CERTs for collecting and processing security 
 feeds, pastebins, tweets and log files using a message queuing protocol. 
 It's a community driven initiative called IHAP (Incident Handling 
 Automation Project) which was conceptually designed 
 by European CERTs during several InfoSec events. Its main goal is to 
 give to incident responders an easy way to collect & process threat 
 intelligence thus improving the incident handling processes of CERTs.
 .
 IntelMQ's design was influenced by AbuseHelper
